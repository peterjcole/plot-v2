# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start Next.js dev server (http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` — Production build. **run this locally before committing to verify output.**
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint (flat config, core-web-vitals + typescript)

No test framework is configured.

## Architecture

This is a Next.js 16 app (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4). The current codebase is primarily a screenshot generator — it renders a Leaflet map with an activity route, photos, and stats, then uses Puppeteer to capture the result as a PNG/JPEG.

**Planned direction:** The app is being redesigned into a full activity browsing + route planning product (combined map view, see `mockup-h.html`). The screenshot pipeline is one feature of this broader product, not the entire app. When touching architecture, bear this in mind.

### Route Groups

- `(main)` — Standard app pages with fonts/global CSS (currently default Next.js landing page)
- `(render)` — Minimal layout (no fonts/styles) used exclusively for Puppeteer screenshot rendering. The render layout strips all margin/padding/overflow so the page captures cleanly.

### Screenshot Pipeline

1. **API route** (`app/api/activity-printout/route.ts`) — Entry point. Accepts `activityId`, `width`, `height`, `format` query params. Launches headless Chromium via Puppeteer, navigates to the render page, waits for `window.__MAP_READY__`, then captures a screenshot.
2. **Render page** (`app/(render)/render/[activityId]/page.tsx`) — Server component that fetches activity data and passes it to `RenderClient`.
3. **RenderClient** — Client component that dynamically imports `ActivityMap` with SSR disabled (Leaflet requires browser APIs).
4. **ActivityMap** — Renders a `react-leaflet` MapContainer with route polyline, photo markers, tile layer, and a text overlay with stats. Sets `window.__MAP_READY__ = true` once tiles load (with a 5s fallback timeout).

### Key Libraries

- `@sparticuz/chromium` + `puppeteer-core` — Headless Chrome for screenshots (configured as `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`)
- `react-leaflet` / `leaflet` — Map rendering (client-side only, must use `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false`)

### Data Layer

`lib/strava.ts` currently returns mock data. It's designed to be replaced with real Strava API calls. Types are defined in `lib/types.ts` (`ActivityData`, `ActivityPhoto`, `ActivityStats`).

The Strava API returns more fields than the current types expose. Fields available from `GET /activities/{id}` not yet in `ActivityStats`: `elev_high`, `elev_low`, `average_heartrate`, `max_heartrate`, `average_cadence`, `calories`, `gear.name`. Photos come from `GET /activities/{id}/photos?size=600` — each has `urls`, `location[lat, lng]`, `caption`.

### Code style

Refactoring to eliminate duplication is encouraged, even as part of a bug fix. If fixing a bug reveals that two call sites share identical logic, extracting a shared helper is the right move — don't leave duplicated code just because the primary goal was a bug fix.

### Icons

Use Lucide React icons (`import { IconName } from 'lucide-react'`). Never use Unicode symbols (↩ ↪ ⊗ etc.) as UI icons. Inline SVG is acceptable only when no suitable Lucide icon exists.

### Design / Mockups

Standalone HTML mockup files (`mockup-a.html` through `mockup-h.html`) live at the project root. These are design references only — not app code. The most current target design is `mockup-h.html` (combined map: activities + planner on a single full-bleed map surface). See project memory for design tokens and UX decisions.

### Path Alias

`@/*` maps to the project root (configured in `tsconfig.json`).

### Auth
- We are using a more recent version of nextjs where middleware was renamed to      
  proxy
- There are limitations in nextjs on where cookies can be updated, which we         
  need to bear in mind
